					<h2>The Big Island</h2>
					<p>Hawaii is simply beautiful! As a Journeyman Millwright my husband was required to travel 8-10 months per year
						and we always took 2 vacations. Summer and winter. So this particular time, my error turned into the absolute
						best trip I think either of us had ever experienced. 
						
						I purchased tickets to Honolulu but made hotel reservations on The Big Island. I thought they were one in the same.
						Not! Honolulu is the 'Main Island'.  The 'Big Island' is actually Kona. However, beauty is an understatement. 
						We had so much fun.  
						
						We attended a Luau and watched them dig up the ceremonial pig that had been cooked undergroud.  We also watched an 
						awesome dance ritual and learned some history of Hawaii. The water was so blue and clear. The Hawaiin shaved ice was addictive.  I ate it several times a day.
						Our trip lasted 9 days and it was not long enough.  If you ever have the chance to visit Hawaii check out Kona, The Big Island.

					<h2>Myrtle Beach, South Carolina</h2>
					<p>Myrtle Beach is a place I had heard of but never visited.  My husband and I were committed to making
						new memories together once our children were grown. Myrtle Beach was so fun and relaxing at the same time.  
						I absolutely love the beach,even though, I cannot swim a lick! </p>

					<a name="Sydney"></a>
					<h2>Sydney, Australia</h2>
					<p>The Great Barrier Reef was also on my "50 by 50" list.  My trip to Australia was beyond awesome! I was able to hold a Koala, an owl, 
						see a white tip shark in it's natural habitat, see The Great Barrier Reef up close and personal. I ordered Kangaroo Steak and a Kangaroo 
						Burger and visted the Sydney Opera House. This was really a tall feat considering the fact that I swim like a rock.  Regardless, it was the trip of a lifetime. </p>
